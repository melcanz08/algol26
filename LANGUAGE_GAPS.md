# ALGOL26 Language Gaps

Discovered by the ChainCSS port attempt (`~/dev/web/chaincss/diff-corpus/`).

## G1 — `PassMetadata` index signature

TypeScript's `PassMetadata` has `[passNamespace: string]: unknown`.
ALGOL26 records cannot represent open-ended key sets. Needs a policy
decision before Phase 4.

**Status:** Deferred to Phase 4.

## G2 — `CSSValueNode` (CSS value AST)

`IRDeclarationMeta.ast` uses an 11-variant recursive union with its own
recursive-descent parser (`parseCSSValue`). A sub-compiler in its own
right.

**Status:** Deferred to Phase 2E or 3. Phase 2A represents it as
`Option[JsonValue]`.

## G3 — `Json` numeric tower

ALGOL26's `examples/json/json.gol` has `Num(Int)` only. ChainCSS IR
needs both integer and float values (specificity 0.1, timestamps,
dimensions like 1.5em). Fix: two-variant `Json` with `NumInt(Int)` and
`NumFloat(Float)`.

**Status:** Resolved by design decision. ~10 lines.

## G4 — `List.push` (FALSE ALARM — resolved)

**Correction.** Earlier assessment was wrong. `List.append(x)` exists
and works: `docs/decisions/0028-list-append.md` (status: Current),
dispatch arm at `src/backends/interpreter/eval.rs:1500`, corpus test
at `tests/corpus/corpus_42_list_append_llvm.gol`.

`List.append` is method-form, mutating, requires `var`, returns `Void`,
interpreter-only (LLVM/WASM refuse via `Feature::ListAppend`). It does
not appear in `src/builtins.rs` because it is dispatched directly in
`eval_builtin_call`, same pattern as `Map.insert` — which is why the
initial grep missed it.

**Status:** Resolved. No language work needed. Phase 2A-pre-1 removed.

## G5 — `Int.parse` / `Float.parse` (RESOLVED)

No `Int.parse` or `Float.parse` builtins. But `String.to_chars` returns
`List[Char]`, and `Char.to_int` returns the codepoint. Digit parsing is
a 10-line helper. Float parsing is ~80-120 lines. No language feature
needed.

**Status:** Resolved by existing primitives.

## G6 — `Map` capability constraints

`Map` is interpreter-only (LLVM/WASM refuse). Iteration order is
unspecified; current interpreter sorts `keys()`. JSON output order may
not be preserved byte-for-byte.

**Status:** Constraint. Phase 2 runs under `--interpreter`. Phase 2D
comparison must be structural, not byte-for-byte.

## G7 — `List` capability matrix

Interpreter: full. LLVM: partial. WASM: unverified. Same constraint as G6.

**Status:** Constraint. Interpreter-only for Phase 2.

## Note on the G4 error (2026-10-31)

G4 was recorded as a hard blocker before checking `docs/decisions/`,
`docs/features/`, and `tests/corpus/` for existing implementations.
Three files were already on disk answering the question:

- `docs/decisions/0028-list-append.md`
- `tests/corpus/corpus_42_list_append_llvm.gol`
- `docs/features/list.md` (incomplete — did not list `append`)

Correction: **check existing ADRs, tests, and feature docs before
declaring a language gap.** A gap that already has a landed ADR is
not a gap. Future entries in this file should cite what was checked,
not just what was found missing.
